here header and footer were copied from index.html file to layout.html file, see last commit code,
now layout.html file has only body so the body for the page will be taken from the index.html into layout.html
by extending the layout.html

so in layout.html 

 {% block body %} {% endblock %}

 this statement is added where we want to add the body and in index.html there is code for body so we write that code between

 {% extends "layout.html" %}
{% block body %}

{% endblock %}

for data base we will use xamp we configure xamp in lecture 7
added data base coneectivity
flask mail functionality is added but it won't work until user credential added in json
in lecture 12 we added support for adding post from the database.
In lecture 13 we are displaying the posts in our blog and we want that when someone click on one of the posts, it should
open and display full content of the post. for this we willl use for loop in index.html
so it will look like this
        {% for post in posts %}
                  
                    <div class="post-preview">
                        <a href="post/{{post.slug}}">
                            <h2 class="post-title"> {{ post.title}}</h2>
                            <h3 class="post-subtitle">{{post.tagline}}</h3>
                        </a>
                        <p class="post-meta">
                            Posted by
                            <a href="#!">Start Bootstrap</a>
                            on {{post.date}}
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    {{post.content[0:143]}}....
                    {% endfor %}
                    <!-- Divider-->

in main.py we do following changes
@app.route("/")
def home():
    posts = Posts.query.filter_by().all()
    return render_template('index.html', params=params, posts=posts)

And then using localhost/phpmyadmin we add new Posts
but we want to take 5 posts to display so in config.json we add new entry "no_of_posts":5
so the line changes to 
posts = Posts.query.filter_by().all()[0:5]
or 
posts = Posts.query.filter_by().all()[0:params["no_of_posts"]]
we can write change json file and change no of posts for eg we can write  "no_of_posts":3
and three posts will be displayed
