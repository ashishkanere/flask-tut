here header and footer were copied from index.html file to layout.html file, see last commit code,
now layout.html file has only body so the body for the page will be taken from the index.html into layout.html
by extending the layout.html

so in layout.html 

 {% block body %} {% endblock %}

 this statement is added where we want to add the body and in index.html there is code for body so we write that code between

 {% extends "layout.html" %}
{% block body %}

{% endblock %}

for data base we will use xamp we configure xamp in lecture 7
added data base coneectivity
